**PROBLEM 1**
Eulerâ€™s sieve is a souped-up version of the sieve of Eratosthenes, which finds the prime numbers. It works
as follows:
A. Write a Matlab function EulerSieve1(N) which constructs the Euler sieve, implementing L, L1, L2 as arrays of integers, as above.

B. Write a Matlab function EulerSieve2(N) which constructs the Euler sieve, implementing L, L1, and L2 as Boolean arrays, where L[I] = 1 if I is currently in the set L. 

**PROBLEM 2**
A. Assume that the polygon is represented by two vectors: Px, the array of x-coordinates and Py, the array
of y-coordinates. Write a Matlab function [Qx,Qy]=ConnectMidpoints(P) that, given a polygon Px,Py constructs the coordinates of the midpoints of P in sequence

B. Write a Matlab function ConvergingPolygons(P,N) which takes as input a polygon P and a number and draws pictures of the first N polygons in this sequence, starting with P. As in the pictures on the
next page, it should alternate pictures that show the polygon with pictures that show the polygon and the midpoints.
